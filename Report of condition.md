#Status of the Project


I built a frame work using java.swing classes

The .txt files represents the script flow, with each acting as an object
contaning the dialog and only ends when a decision is needed to be made.

The Frame Class is the main brains of the code. Set up a window to display
the text. I am thinking of using a scanner and take the script line by line
using markers like integers for setting up things like choice buttons(this 
is the decisionScreen method).

THE PROBLEMS SO FAR

    -Texts is obstructed by the previous or blank text
    -Decision buttons are not able to handle path decision
    -Decision detection only acts on the first script

THINGS TO THINK/DO

    -User name input
    -Graphics
    -Mentioned problems 
    -other ways to process the script
    -Think about how to add the point sytems
