# COMP-363-Final-Project

This program simulates a game that allows the user to interact with non-player characters in a college setting
with the purpose of demonstrating the complexities of interpersonal relationships. This game is driven by conversation,
but also includes player feelings and biases that make it a realistic RPG. 

The game runs on a decision tree that allows the user to play through several unique outcomes, depending on what 
motivations they chose to pursue. Its purpose is to simulate how every decision a person makes effects their
opportunities and overall life path. 

# How To Play
First, launch the game in a VM to prompt the title page and the introduction. The screen will display conversation options
that the player will have to chose from. The game will not continue forward unless an option is chosen, and once the player
has reached the end of their chosen path, their final outcome and game statistics will be displayed. Players can then
choose to use the stats to play again for a different outcome, or not at all. There are several conversation paths
available, so see if you can find them all!


# Motivations
As our future becomes increasingly technologically dependant, virtual realities and digital social apps have become 
the primary form of communication for a large majority of the world. Projects like the METAverse and AXS prompted our 
interest in analyzing how we could make an interaction between a computer and a human as authentic as possible. 


# Design Process
To simulate feelings and moods, we defined variables for each character in the game that described their general
personality, then modified those variables after each interaction between the characters. Just like real-life interaction,
certain conversation paths are blocked from the player depending on the current feelings of the NPCs, and vise-versa.
Players must factor in their own character's feelings, as well as those of the NPCs they are interacting with in order
to get the outcome they desire.
