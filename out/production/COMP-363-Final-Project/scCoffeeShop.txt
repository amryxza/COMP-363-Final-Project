→ You flop back into bed. Not today, Satan.
A few hours later, you wake groggily to sunlight blinding you. The desire for caffeine itches you, and you make your way towards a popular coffee shop just off campus.
-> While in line to order, something bumps into you, and you stumble backwards, right into someone’s fresh cup of hot coffee. Although the liquid has soaked through your clothes as well, you apologize profusely and run to grab napkins for your unfortunate victim.
"I’m so sorry," you say.                                           "It’s fine!" they respond, beaming.
"I’m Cal," they say. "Do you want to get a seat together?"
Their desire to sit with a stranger is baffling.
"Sure," you say. / "Sorry, I have a class," you say, as apologetic as you can muster.
