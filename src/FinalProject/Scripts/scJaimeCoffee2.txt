You somehow manage to grab a table just as its previous occupants leave.
A sip of your coffee reveals that it is far too bitter. You grimace.
I’m going to go get sugar and cream, you clarify.
While rummaging through sugar packets, something bumps into you, and you stumble backwards
Right into someone’s fresh cup of hot coffee.
Although the liquid has soaked through your clothes as well, you apologize profusely and run to grab napkins for your unfortunate victim.
I’m so sorry, you say.
It’s fine! they respond, beaming.
The burst of enthusiasm is startling after dealing with Jamie for so long.
I’m Cal, they say. Do you want to get a seat together?
###
Their desire to sit with a stranger is baffling. what do you do?
You show them back to your table, where Jamie appears to be disassociating
I don’t think there are tables indoors, you say. Do you want to sit outside?
Sorry, I have a class, you say, as apologetic as you can muster.
