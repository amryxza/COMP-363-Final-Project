I don’t like coffee,
 they say after a moment of silence.
 That’s alright, you say. Come along anyway.
 You both make your way towards a popular coffee shop just off campus.
 You try to convince yourself that it’s a companionable silence. (It’s not.)
 ....
Do you do anything on campus? Like clubs or anything?
No.
Hm. What’s your major?
Psychology.
Oh! Is that interesting?
No.
...
Doesn’t Jamie do anything?
Any hobbies?
@@@
     What is this, an interrogation?
     You lapse into silence in an effort to not scare off Jamie. /
     You tell Jamie about yourself, at the risk of them leaving you out of sheer annoyance.
