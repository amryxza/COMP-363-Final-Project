→Groaning, you drag yourself out of bed.
 Duty calls.
 You pass the class: paying attention / observing the people around you.
→ Although the class is interesting,
you cannot bring yourself to focus so early in the morning.
Your gaze meanders across the room, picking  people apart.
It’s the same people in the same outfits with the same dead expressions on their faces.
Well, actually...
not quite.
There’s someone here who hasn’t shown up     since the first day of the semester several        months ago.
 How have they even taken exams? you wonder.
They don’t have any sort of note-taking device  and it looks like they’re on the verge of passing out.
???
After class, you...
forget about them
approach them.
